### Changed
- Updated SICP logger dependency to 1.1.6
- All log information from the native iOS/MacOS CUBB is now sent to Unity and logged via the SiCP logger
  This means that the native log can be seen alongside the unity log in the SiCP log output. 
- Experimental support for sending assets to LEAF hubs. This works for firmware upgrading and sending other assets.  
  To try it out, select a compatible firwmare file from the LDSDK example FW upgrade view.

- Changed Android Logging, to support multiple native loggers. Log level filtering applies.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-07-01

### Added
- Updated Unity project version to 2018.4.0f1 LTS, 
  your editor should be updated accordingly.
- Updated scripting backend to .NET 4.x.
- Updated SICP logger dependency to 1.1.5

### Changed
**iOS**
- Updated SWIFT version to 5.0 to be able to target newer devices. 
  It requires Xcode 10.2+ to be installed to link the libraries, 
  your Xcode should be updated accordingly.
- Changed iOS bluetooth implementation to manually disconnect 
  all devices when CBManagerState changes from on to off. 
  Change was made because iOS dosen't report correct callbacks didDisconnectPeripheral 
  when bluetooth is disabled in Control Center (LDSDK-344).
- All log information from the native iOS/MacOS CUBB 
  is now sent to Unity and logged via. the SiCP logger.
  This means that the native log can be seen alongside 
  the unity log in the SiCP log output.

**Android**
- Fixed a bug when using SendStrategy.SoftAck, where too many acks were requested (LDSDK-343).


## [1.0.0] - 2019-01-23
### Added
- Updated Unity project version to 2018.2.11f1, your editor should be updated accordingly.

### Fixed
- When bluetooth is disabled, the device list is now cleared.


## [0.2.0] - 2019-01-21
### Added
- Send strategy is now configurable on a connection basis.  This
  feature is useful for connecting to City hubs, which at present have
  limitations because of hardware issues. Use SendStrategy.HardAck for
  these (the default is SoftAck); in bootloader mode, though, you'll
  need to use SendStrategy.NoAck.

- When SendStrategy.NoAck is in use, you will still get
  PacketTransmitted feedback - though in this mode, the feedback
  carries less guarantee: only that the packet is sent (passed to the
  Bluetooth library), not that it is acknowledged by the other end.

### Changed
- A NoAck send strategy implies timer-based throttling on both iOS and
  Android.

### Fixed
- The Android native part was not thread safe, which might lead to race-condition issues in some situations (LDSDK-152)
- Android API didn't support reliable full duplex on a single GATT characteristic. (LDSDK-199)
  A workaround has been implemented.
- Bluetooth adapter state is missing update on DisabledÂ»StartScanning (LDSDK-150)
- Bluetooth adapter state is wrong after reenabling Bluetooth (LDSDK-151)

## [0.0.1] - 2018-11-13
